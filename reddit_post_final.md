**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This bot contains dark humor and sarcastic responses. It's designed for entertainment and information purposes. The roasting is all in good fun - don't take it personally! 😂**

Wassup r/bitsatards! 🔥

Listen, I've been watching this subreddit like a creepy stalker for months now. Y'all keep asking the SAME cutoff questions every damn day, having mental breakdowns over mock scores, and basically speedrunning depression. So my chaotic brain was like "you know what? Let me create a bot that'll answer your questions AND emotionally damage you at the same time."

Because honestly? If we're all gonna suffer through this BITSAT hell together, might as well get roasted by a robot while we're at it. Peak 2024 energy, no? 😈

## 🎯 What Does This Menace Do?

**No_Attendance_Bot** is basically that one toxic friend who knows everything but delivers it with the energy of a disappointed Indian parent. It's got all the BITSAT cutoff data memorized (unlike you memorizing physics formulas) and will serve you facts with a side of emotional trauma.

Think of it as your personal villain origin story - helpful, but make it *psychological warfare*. 💀

## 💬 How to Talk to It?

### Option 1: Direct Commands (Old School)
- `!cutoff` - Shows everything (prepare for information overload)
- `!cutoff for CSE` - CSE cutoffs across all campuses
- `!cutoff for Goa` - All Goa campus cutoffs
- `!cutoff for mechanical in Pilani` - Specific branch + campus

### Option 2: Natural Language (The Cool Way)
Just ask normally! The bot understands:
- "What was the cutoff for Goa?"
- "CSE cutoff kya hai?"
- "Tell me about Hyderabad cutoffs"
- "Biology ke liye kitne marks?"
- "Required score for ECE"

## 📊 What Cutoff Data Does It Have?

**Complete BITSAT 2024 cutoffs for your inevitable disappointment:**

🏛️ **Pilani Campus** (The original dream crusher)
🏖️ **Goa Campus** (Where dreams go to die by the beach)
🏙️ **Hyderabad Campus** (Tech city trauma center)

**All branches covered (so nowhere to hide):**
- Engineering: CSE, ECE, EEE, Mechanical, Chemical, Civil, Manufacturing, Math & Computing, Instrumentation
- M.Sc: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Economics, Mathematics
- Pharmacy: B.Pharm

## 🕘 Bot Schedule (Because Even Demons Need Sleep)

**Active**: 9 AM to 1 AM (16 hours of pure chaos)
**Inactive**: 1 AM to 9 AM (beauty sleep for maximum toxicity)

## 😈 What Makes This Chaos Agent Special?

1. **Unhinged Dark Humor**: Responses like "Prepare for emotional devastation" and "Time for complete destruction mode"
2. **Toxic Hinglish Energy**: Perfect mix of Hindi and English because that's how we roast people irl
3. **Unique Trauma Every Time**: Uses AI wizardry to ensure each roast hits different (no recycled pain)
4. **Faster Than Your Hopes Dying**: Responds within 5-15 seconds (unlike your BITSAT prep progress)
5. **Motivational Destruction**: Will absolutely demolish your confidence then tell you to "embrace your dark era"

## 🎭 Sample Emotional Damage Style

**Your innocent question:** "What's the CSE cutoff for Pilani?"

**Bot's psychological warfare response:** "Arre [username], CSE at PILANI? Prepare for emotional damage:

🏛️ **PILANI CAMPUS** 
*The original dream crusher*

• CSE: 327/390

Numbers don't define you - but they sure love to roast you! 💀 
Cutoff dekh ke cry mat kar, grind kar! Tears won't get you admission 😈

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Bot only works in r/bitsatards (obviously)
- Only responds to specific cutoff questions (won't spam)
- Won't reply to AutoModerator or other bots
- Includes official BITS cutoff link for verification
- Contains toxic levels of dark humor - if you get roasted, that's character development bestie 💀

## 🤝 Feedback?

If you find any bugs, want new features, or just want to trauma-bond over my coding skills, drop a comment! My ego is as fragile as your BITSAT confidence, so please be gentle (or don't, I'm into that).

If the bot roasts you too hard, remember - it's just preparing you for the disappointment of adult life. BITSAT is temporary, but the emotional damage is forever! That's what builds character! 💪😈

---

**TL;DR**: Created an unhinged digital demon that knows all BITSAT cutoffs and will absolutely destroy your self-esteem while helping you. Ask it anything about cutoffs and prepare for psychological warfare disguised as helpful information.

Stay toxic, fellow BITSATards! We're all in this suffering together! 🔥💀

*P.S. - The bot's name is "No_Attendance_Bot" because attendance is a social construct and we're all just winging it anyway. Also, it matches the energy of this entire subreddit.* 😈

*P.P.S. - If you're reading this and crying, that's just Tuesday in BITSAT prep. The bot didn't break you, life did. We're just here for the vibes.* 🎭
